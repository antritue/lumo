# Lumo — Product Overview

## 1. What is Lumo?

**Lumo** is a simple, calm, and trustworthy tool that gives independent landlords clear, reliable answers about rent payments — without spreadsheets, notebooks, or constant double-checking.

Lumo solves one problem well:
> Whenever you need to know who has paid and who hasn't, you get a clear, reliable answer instantly. To provide this clarity, Lumo keeps a simple, reliable record of rooms, rent amounts, and payment history — without unnecessary features.

The product is intentionally minimal, built for landlords who:
- Manage 8–25 rooms across one or more properties
- Still track rent with Excel, paper, or memory
- Want clarity, not complexity

---

## 2. Target Users

### Who Lumo is For

Independent landlords who:
- Manage **~8–25 rooms** (the range where manual tracking breaks down)
- Own or personally manage one or more properties with multiple rooms
- Track rent status personally (not delegating to teams)

This includes:
- Landlords managing their own properties
- Solo property managers who personally track rent

### Who Lumo is NOT For

- Landlords with fewer than 5 rooms (Excel/paper still work fine)
- Property management teams or agencies
- Enterprise or commercial property operators
- Anyone needing tenant CRM, maintenance ticketing, or full accounting

### Early Survey Data (4 responses, Jan 2026)
- Landlords with **more rooms** show greater interest and willingness to pay
- Landlords with **fewer rooms** can manage with simpler tools
- Sweet spot appears to be 8–25 rooms; needs more validation

**Positioning note:** Target by behavior (personal rent tracking), not by job title.

## 3. Core Problem

The problem Lumo solves is **lack of clarity at payment review moments**.

When landlords need to check rent status, they face:
- **Confusion:** "Did they actually pay, or did I miss it?"
- **Manual Work:** Checking bank statements, messages, notebooks, spreadsheets
- **Mental Load:** Remembering who paid, who's late, who always forgets
- **Stress:** Second-guessing themselves before following up

This confusion compounds as the number of rooms grows. Around 8 rooms, manual tracking becomes unreliable.

Lumo replaces confusion with clarity: open the app and know immediately where things stand.

---

## 4. Product Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Lumo must always be:

- **Simple** – fewer features, done well
- **Calm** – no visual noise, no pressure
- **Friendly** – plain language, no jargon
- **Trustworthy** – clear data, predictable behavior


If a feature adds complexity without removing confusion, it does not belong in Lumo.

- Create properties (houses/buildings)
- Create rooms within each property

---

## 6. Free vs Paid Thinking (Pending Validation)

> [!NOTE]
> Working hypothesis based on early survey data (4 responses, Jan 2026). Subject to change with more validation.

### Strategic Thinking

**Goal:** Free tier proves value. Paid tier unlocks clarity at scale.

**Free tier should end before pain peaks.**
- At 5 rooms, landlords can still manage manually
- At 8+ rooms, uncertainty and mental load increase sharply
- Free tier stops at ~5 rooms so users can experience Lumo before manual tracking becomes stressful.


### Working Assumptions

**Free Tier (~5 rooms)**
- All core features included
- No time limit
- No feature gating
- Rationale: Build trust, prove simplicity, create habit

**Paid Upgrade (6+ rooms)**
- Triggered by room count, not features
- One-time payment (no subscriptions)
- Same features, more rooms
- Rationale: Clarity at scale is the unlock, not new features

**Why one-time payment?**
- Removes ongoing friction and decision fatigue
- Aligns with user mindset (landlords think in ownership)
- Simple to explain and justify

### Why Room Count?

- Natural upgrade moment (you feel the pain before hitting the limit)
- Aligns with user value (more rooms = more uncertainty = more value from Lumo)
- Easy to understand and explain
- No feature gating preserves simplicity

**Philosophy:** Free users are not failures. They are future upgrades, referrals, and proof that the product is simple enough.

---

## 7. Monetization Direction

### Payment Model
- **One-time payment** (no subscriptions)
- Price range: TBD (likely $20–60 USD)
- Unlocks additional capacity (assumed to be unlimited rooms)

### Upgrade Trigger
- Happens when user tries to create 6th room
- Presented calmly, not aggressively
- Clear value statement: "Manage all your rooms with clarity"

All pricing and thresholds are working hypotheses until validated by real usage.

## 8. Brand Tone & Voice

Lumo speaks like a calm, reliable friend — not a sales pitch.

**Voice:**
- Calm
- Respectful
- Grounded

**Language Rules:**
- No tech jargon or SaaS buzzwords
- No urgency language ("Act now!", "Limited time!")
- Prefer everyday wording ("rent" not "receivables")
- Speak **with** users, not **at** them

**Example tone:**
- Good: "See who's paid this month"
- Bad: "Maximize your rental revenue with our powerful dashboard"

---

## 9. Design Direction

- Mobile-first
- Clean layouts
- Large readable text
- Soft spacing
- Minimal color palette
- No aggressive CTAs

Design should feel:
> “I can trust this and understand it at a glance.”

---

## 10. What Lumo Is NOT

Be explicit about what we are not building:

- **Not a full property management system** (no tenant CRM, maintenance, leases)
- **Not built for teams or agencies** (single-user tool)
- **Not feature-rich** (we win by staying small)
- **Not trying to replace accountants** (no complex reporting or tax features)
- **Not for investors or speculators** (for operators who track rent personally)

---

## 11. Success Definition

Lumo is successful when:

**Functional Success:**
- Users can answer "Who has paid?" instantly, without double-checking
- Users stop using Excel, paper, or bank statement searches
- Users trust Lumo as their source of truth

**Emotional Success:**
- Users feel **confident** when following up on late payments
- Users feel **calm** during payment review (no stress or second-guessing)
- Users feel **relieved** they don't have to remember or cross-check

**Word-of-Mouth Success:**
- Users describe Lumo as "simple and clear"
- Users recommend it to other landlords unprompted

---

## 12. Long-Term Direction (Optional)

Extensions to consider only **after** core workflow is proven and loved:

- Payment history and reporting (longer timelines)
- Multi-property rollup view
- Gentle payment reminders (if users want them)
- Data export (for accountants)

**Critical rule:** No extension should compromise simplicity or add mental load.

---

## 13. Guiding Question (Always Ask)

Before building or changing anything:

> **Does this give landlords more clarity when they review rent payments?**

If the answer is not clearly "yes", don't build it.
