# Lumo — Product Overview

## 1. What is Lumo?

**Lumo** is a simple, calm, and reliable tool that helps small landlords manage rental rooms clearly — without spreadsheets, notebooks, or messy records.

Lumo focuses on the **core problem**:
> Tracking monthly rent, payment history, and rooms across one or more houses — clearly and without confusion.

The product is intentionally minimal, built for landlords who:
- Manage multiple rooms (3+)
- Still rely on Excel, paper, or memory
- Want clarity, not complexity

---

## 2. Target Users

### Primary
- Small landlords managing **3–10 rooms**
- Not highly technical
- Prefer simple, familiar workflows
- Often older, practical, value clarity and reliability

### Secondary
- Landlords with **10+ rooms** who want a lightweight tool
- New landlords who want to avoid messy tracking early

---

## 3. Core Problem

Landlords struggle with:
- Forgetting or missing late payments
- Confusion about which room paid
- Messy or lost records
- Constant double-checking
- No clear payment history over time

These problems **increase sharply** as the number of rooms grows.

---

## 4. Product Principles (Non-Negotiable)

Lumo must always be:

- **Simple** – fewer features, done well
- **Calm** – no visual noise, no pressure
- **Friendly** – plain language, no jargon
- **Trustworthy** – clear data, predictable behavior


If a feature adds complexity without removing confusion, it does not belong in Lumo.

## 5. MVP Scope (Phase 1)

### Included
- Create properties (houses)
- Create rooms within a property
- Track monthly rent per room
- Record payment status (paid / unpaid)
- View payment history per room
- Clear overview of all rooms and their status

---

## 6. Free vs Paid Thinking (Pending Validation)

> [!NOTE]
> This section is currently under investigation. Monetization triggers and free tier limits will be finalized based on survey results.

### Early Direction
- **Free Experience:** Focus on proving core value and building trust.
- **Possible Paid Triggers:** Clarity at scale (managing more rooms) or advanced history/reporting.

Pricing should unlock **clarity at scale**, not basic usage.


---

## 7. Monetization Direction

- Likely **one-time payment**, not subscription
- Upgrade tied to:
  - Number of rooms
  - History depth
  - Long-term usage

Free users are not failures — they are:
- Future upgrades
- Referrals
- Validation of simplicity

---

## 8. Brand Tone & Voice

Lumo’s voice is:
- Neutral
- Respectful
- Calm
- Non-salesy

### Language rules
- Avoid tech jargon
- Avoid buzzwords
- Prefer plain, everyday wording
- Speak **with** users, not **at** them


---

## 9. Design Direction

- Mobile-first
- Clean layouts
- Large readable text
- Soft spacing
- Minimal color palette
- No aggressive CTAs

Design should feel:
> “I can trust this and understand it at a glance.”

---

## 10. What Lumo Is NOT

- Not a full property management system
- Not built for enterprises
- Not feature-heavy
- Not trying to replace accountants
- Not optimized for investors or speculators

Lumo wins by **being small, focused, and clear**.

---

## 11. Success Definition (Early)

Lumo is successful when:
- Users can answer “Who has paid?” instantly
- Users stop using Excel or notebooks
- Users feel less stressed at month-end
- Users recommend it as “simple and clear”

---

## 12. Long-Term Direction (Optional)

Future extensions may include:
- Better history and reporting
- Multi-property overview
- Gentle reminders
- Data export

Only after the core workflow is proven and loved.

---

## 13. Guiding Question (Always Ask)

Before adding anything:
> Does this make rent tracking clearer for a small landlord?

If the answer is not clearly “yes”, don’t build it.
